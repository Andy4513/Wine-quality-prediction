# Wine_quality_prediction
 
The goal of this project is to analyze and make predictions based on the physiochemical data of a winery's wine. Some important goals of the project are:

- analyzing the distribution of wine quality
- distributions of wine proprieties
- comparasion between white and red wine
- quality prediction using machine learning
- wine type (white/red) based on their properties

The project is divided into 4 parts:

### Part 1

In this part we load the data, clean it, and prepare the necessary dataframe for next parts.

### Part 2

In part 2 we analyze the distribution of the wines, look for correlation between attributes and compare the different proprieties for red and white wine.

### Part 3

Use machine learning to predict the quality of wine and find the best algorithm for this problem.

### Part 4

Use machine learning to predict whether the wine is red or white based on its physiochemical proprieties.
